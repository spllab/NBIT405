# NBIT405 Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems

## Course Description:
* This course is an introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), covering algorithmic techniques
and data structures used in modern problem-solving environments. Each topic will have a
related assignment where the learned techniques are applied to simple games and also student will
build an intelligent systems application via web technologies.

## Course Outline:
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
* What is AI? What can Modern AI do?
* Games as a Testing Environment for AI
* Agents, Environments, and Problems


Search Algorithms
* Exhaustive Search (BFS / DFS)
* Heuristic Functions / Incorporating Knowledge
* Heuristic Search (Best-First Search / A*)
* Introduction to Game Theory / Nash Equilibrium
* Adversarial Search (Minimax / Alpha-Beta)
* Data Structures / Optimizations for Search


Genetic Algorithms (GA)
* Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms
* GA Representations: (Genotype, Phenotype)
* GA Implementation: Mutation, Crossover, Selection, Reproduction


Reinforcement Learning (RL)
* Introduction to RL: Agent, Environment, Actions, Policies, Rewards
* Bandit Problems (Exploration vs. Exploitation)
* Markov Decision Processes
* Generalized Policy Iteration
* Monte-Carlo Methods
* Temporal Difference Learning (SARSA / Q-Learning)


Neural Networks (NN)
* Artificial Neurons / NN Structure / Training
* Brief Introduction to Deep Learning
